First we need to install conda, which can be done via https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
Then we want to create an environment:

conda create -n dbtut python=3.9

which we enter via:

conda activate dbtut

We then have to install jupyter via:

conda install jupyter

At which point we can enter the notebook provided via

jupyter notebook . 

or 

jupyter lab .
